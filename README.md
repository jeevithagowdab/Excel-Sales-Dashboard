# Sales and Customer Profit Analysis Dashboards

## Project Overview
This project consists of two dashboards built using Excel that analyze **Sales Performance** and **Customer Profitability**. 
The dashboards are designed to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, profit, product trends, and customer demographics. 
The visualizations enable better decision-making by highlighting patterns in sales, product demand, and customer preferences.

## Problem Statement
Businesses with large datasets often struggle to identify critical trends and profit patterns, especially when dealing with diverse products and customers across multiple regions and time periods.
Without clear visualizations, it can be challenging to determine where the company is performing well or where there is room for improvement.

## Solution
This project solves the problem by creating two interactive dashboards that focus on:
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Understanding how revenue, costs, and profits vary across different time periods and products.
- **Customer Profitability Analysis**: Identifying the top-performing products and customers, as well as key demographic insights that influence profitability.

The goal is to help businesses target more profitable products, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer segmentation based on profitability patterns.

## Key Features
### 1. Sales Analysis Dashboard:
- **KPI Comparison to Previous Year**: Analyze Year-over-Year changes in COGS, revenue, quantity, profit, and transaction counts.
- **Yearly Performance Metrics**: Identify years that performed above average in terms of revenue and profit.
- **Monthly Profit Trends**: Track profit patterns on a monthly basis.
- **Profit by Week Type**: Compare profitability across weekdays and weekends.
- **Quarterly Profit Analysis**: Evaluate performance across quarters.
- **Profit by Weekday**: Identify trends in profit based on specific weekdays.

### 2. Product and Customer Analysis Dashboard:
- **Top 5 Profitable Products**: Identify products contributing the most to overall profit.
- **Top 5 Profitable Customers**: Highlight the most profitable customers.
- **Profit by Gender**: Explore gender-based profit trends.
- **Profit by Product Color**: Analyze profit by product color to optimize sales.
- **Profit by Pricing Type**: Examine the effectiveness of pricing strategies.
- **Country-wise Profit**: Use a custom map to display profits by region.
- **Profit by Age Groups**: Segment profit by customer age groups to understand the highest-contributing demographic.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** for data analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- **Excel Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file containing the dashboards.
2. Use the slicers and filters to explore various views of the data (Year, Country, Products, etc.).
3. Analyze KPIs and gain insights on sales and profitability trends.

## Conclusion
These dashboards are valuable tools for businesses looking to optimize product offerings, target high-value customers, and understand the dynamics of their sales across different time periods and regions. This project demonstrates how data can be leveraged effectively to drive business growth and decision-making.
